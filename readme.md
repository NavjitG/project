
Flexbox

i was not very comfortable with using flexbox and found that i was not used to it yet but i was able to make an attempt.
I used flex box on two of my pages the user site map page and about us page. I palyed around with it more on the about us page
and found it very fun and was able to understand how it could be useful.


javascript

Google maps api was implemented on my contact us page, i didnt have and address to put for it so i just set the map marker
to the location of de montfort university

I attempted to implement a slideshow onto my review pages. The slideshow worked fine when i left it in the html however
did not work when i put the javascript in a seperate file. I attempted to fix what it was but could not find the solution
it might be something obivious that i have left out or missed but i have left it in my javascript file and is on lines
22-67. 



Testing

1- making sure all the links are working correctly

    I tested this by going on each individual page and clicking each link that was on the page from navigation to images

2 - Testing slider on the review games

    I tested this by clicking on the arrows to change image of the slider however it did not work

3 - Testing for errors in code
    I tested this by putting the code through html and css validator


References to code i have used and changed
